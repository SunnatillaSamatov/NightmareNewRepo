I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day\n The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
 What a wondeful world

 The colors of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying how do you do
They are really saying
I love you
